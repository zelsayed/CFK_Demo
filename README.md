# Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) for a Nonlinear System

This repository implements a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) for a one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic system. Implemented for UCL COMP0168.

## Problem Setup

We consider a nonlinear system defined by:

### Process Model
$f(x, k) = 0.5x + \frac{25x}{1 + x^2} + 8\cos(1.2k)$

where:
- $x$ is the state variable.
- $k$ is the discrete time index.

### Measurement Model
$h(x) = \frac{x^2}{20}$

### Initial Parameters
- Initial state: $x_0 = 2.0$
- Initial covariance: $P_0 = 1.0$
- Process noise covariance: $Q = 0.1$
- Measurement noise covariance: $R = 0.2$

## Algorithm: Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF)

The CKF is employed for nonlinear state estimation, with prediction and measurement update steps as summarized below:

**Time Update (Prediction)**
1. Compute square-root decomposition: $P_k = SS^T$
2. Generate cubature points:
   $$\chi_i = x_k \pm \sqrt{n}S_{ãƒ»,i}$$
3. Propagate cubature points through the process model $f(x, k)$.
4. Calculate the predicted state mean and covariance.

**Measurement Update**
1. Compute square-root decomposition: $P_{k+1}^- = SS^T$
2. Generate cubature points around the predicted state.
3. Propagate cubature points through the measurement model $h(x)$.
4. Compute the predicted measurement mean and covariance.
5. Calculate the cross-covariance and Kalman gain.
6. Update the state estimate and covariance with the new measurement.

## Output

The implementation demonstrates one complete CKF update cycle from $k = 0$ to $k = 1$, providing updated state estimates and covariances.
